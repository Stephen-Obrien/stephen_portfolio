## About Me

I am research chemist with a master's of Science in Polymer and Coatings Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. My aim with my education and this repository is to move into a career as a computational chemist. I have been using Rstudio to clean and filter data sets, create visuals and tables, and automate work flows in my research work. Additionally, I have been built predictive models using a combination of models I learned from HarvardX's Data Science Certificate program. My projects have been completed using R and RStudio, but I am working through HarvardX's python for data science course now and will upload python code to this repo soon.
